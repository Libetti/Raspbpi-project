# Raspbpi-project
Various simple applications to be used with a RaspberryPi and Sense HAT.

# Etch-A-Sketch
A traditional Etch-A-Sketch that takes in user input from the joystick and lights up pixels accordingly
on an 8 by 8 sense hat. Clicking in on the joystick will change the color of your pixel between red, blue and, green.
The accelerometer detects great changes in motion to clear the bitmap, like shaking an Etch-A-Sketch.

# Binary Clock
A binary clock that represents hours, minutes, and seconds shown through lit and unlit pixels on the sense HAT.
The time shown refers to your OS system timezone.
